            Hi! <br>
            I'm Dahye Kim,<br>
            currently a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.<br>
            
            To talk about my past and the reason why I chose computer engineering,<br>
            
            I came to Canada by myself when I was 16 to let myself to learn and experience the world.<br>
            One day when I was in a library, <br>
            I came across a book that inspired me to choose computer engineering as my future career pathway.<br> The book was a report written by the UN which predicted what may be in store in the future.<br> 
            They envision that most surgeries will be done by robots,<br>
             portable 3D scanners will be used widely to produce materials <br>
             which people can scan and print it out directly,<br>
             everyone will enjoy virtual reality in daily life,<br>
             and most importantly, computers will be a core of everything.<br>
             These may sound like something everyone knows nowadays,<br>
             but I read this book few years ago and at that time,<br>
             I didn't know what 3D printers are and virtual reality game is.<br>
             And couldn't even imagine doctors being replaced by robots.<br>
             
             While reading the book, I saw the new world and it made me realize that <br>
             there are going to be pivotal changes in the future and it made my heart beat.<br>
            
             So I would like to be a pioneer of the technologically advanced era <br>
            and that is why I am determined to become an engineer;<br>
            to make the impossible possible and make the dreams a reality in the world.<br>
            
             I can already see virtual reality is becoming familiar to many people,<br>
             and also can see 3D printers pretty often around me.<br>   
             The world is changing very rapidly,<br>
              I realized I need to go a step ahead of the world,<br>
            so I am and will always be trying my best to learn more,<br> 
            and perform the best to achieve my dream sooner than I expect.<br>
            
            <br>
            To talk about things I enjoy,
            I enjoy baking, cooking, making miniatures and anything with my hands, <br>
            also like trying new hobbies,<br>
            I have tried making clothes, cosmetics, and soap.<br> 
            I also love board games, poker, escape rooms, so basically things require strategy.<br>
             
             
            <br><br>
            Thank you for reading :)
